# Category Theory as a <br /> Tool for Thought

.horizontalCentered.caption[Daniel Beskin]

???
- We are going to talk about category theory, and how it can be used as a tool to help us think about functional programming
- Before we begin, though, I would like to start with a small introduction, to get us into the right frame of mind

---
## Prelude

???
- If you happen to follow the Haskell world, you quite likely have heard of Edward Kmett
- I will use him as an example of someone who is very proficient in category theory, and the sort of person that inspired this talk
--

.verticalCentered[
> — [someone describing a cool new idea]  
> — ... this is just the **right Kan extension** encoding of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[some other well-known idea]...  
.footnote[Edward Kmett on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1j9n5y/c/cbcwbsa/), edited]
]

???
- This is a somewhat edited quote of a conversation on the Haskell Reddit
- Someone describes a cool new idea that can be useful for functional programming
- And Edward points out that this is just the "right Kan extension" of some other well-known thing
- When seeing something like this, although I've no idea what a Kan extension is
- The first thing that comes to my mind is
- Is there a left Kan extension? Will it produce another equally useful and impressive thing?
- **But delving deeper, this reveals something very profound**
- **What we see here is an example of applying a technique from category theory to derive one idea from another**
- **This is an example of how category theory can be used as a tool to explore what I'll call "the idea space"**
---

## Exploring the Idea Space
---
???
- So what do I mean by "the idea space"
- There are lots of useful ideas in the world
- And every once in a while someone discovers a significant new idea
--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-1.svg)]

???
- If we are lucky this idea might lead us to discover some other related ideas, not as a major, but still nice to have

--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-2.svg)]

???
- Somewhere else, someone might discover another idea
--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-3.svg)]

???
- With its own follow up ideas
--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-4.svg)]
  
???
- Rinse and repeat...

--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-5.svg)]

???

- All of these ideas form the idea space
- The problem with the picture that I'm showing here is that each idea requires some special insight, a eureka moment, or a stroke of genius to be discovered
- And once discovered, it typically won't help you discover other significant ideas
- How can you connect all these differently shaped ideas?
- How can you find a connection between this circle-shaped idea and this square-shaped idea?
- **That is, we are lacking the tools to explore the idea space**
- **In this talk, I'll try to show how category theory can provide us with various tools to help us with this exploration**

--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-6.svg)]

???
- Using techniques from category theory, we'll be able to connect these different shapes in space
- And sometimes, they might even help us discover brand new ideas 

--
.ideaSpace[![](idea-space-7.svg)]

???
- **Category theory will help us explore the idea space in a way that is much more systematic and mechanical then just sitting around waiting for a stroke of genius to hit you on the head**
- So here's what I'm going to talk about

---

## Outline

- Intro
- Categorically speaking
- When in doubt, build a category
- The categorical nomad
- "Case study"

???
- We'll start with a very, very quick introduction to category theory, just the bare basics that we'll need for the talk
- Then we'll see how to translate ideas from programming into the language of category theory, and what benefits we can gain from this translation
- Next, we'll build on this and see how recognizing the structure of categories around us can lead to new insights
- The last class of techniques we'll learn about is how to generalize ideas in a way that makes them "portable" between categories. A very powerful way to discover new structures.
- And we'll wrap up with a "case study", a small application of these techniques to semi-real code
- **Hopefully, by the end of this talk you'll be inspired to approach category theory on your own and use it as a tool for thought**
- Let's dive in

details become invisible, but we can spot patterns that were impossible to detect from ground level.

.footnote[Tom Leinster, Basic Category Theory]

???

- We'll begin with the very basics of category theory
- **For the mathematically inclined amongst you, be advised, that I'll be very loose with various definitions in this talk** 
- Especially with the absence of most laws
- Please don't judge me for it
---

## Category Theory 101

---

???
- So a category consists of a number of things
--

.catTheory101[![](cat-theory-101-1.svg)]

???
- A bunch of objects

--

.catTheory101[![](cat-theory-101-2.svg)]

???
- And a set of arrows between them that we call morphisms
- These must behave nicely, that is, they should compose

---

.catTheory101[![](cat-theory-101-3.svg)]

???

- So for every pair of morphisms that form a path like so

--

.catTheory101[![](cat-theory-101-4.svg)]
???

- We should also have a composite morphism that goes from `A` to `C` that does the same thing

---

layout: false

## The Category of Types

???
- Now, this is fairly abstract, since the objects and morphisms can be pretty much anything
- But since this is a programming conference
- The category that we'll start with is the category that is formed by the types in our type-system
- Namely
--

- Objects: types
  - `Integer`
  - `String`
  - `Boolean`

???
- The objects of the category are the different types that we have
- Each concrete type in the language, such as integers, strings and booleans, will correspond to a single object
--

- Morphisms: functions
  - `show :: Integer -> String`
  - `lessThan5 :: Integer -> Boolean`

???
- Morphisms are functions
- So a function from an integer to a string, corresponds to a morphism between the object `Integer` and the object `String`
- Function composition gives us the composition behavior that morphisms must obey

---

## What It's All About

???
- So from the definitions that we have so far, what is category theory about?
- For the purposes of this talk, we see that it's

--
- Composition

???
- About composition
- Since this is pretty much the only structure that a category has
- **As programmers, this should be of great interest, since things that compose are the things that are the nicest to program with**
- Especially when doing functional programming
- But more importantly for this talk
- Category theory is about

--

- Relationships

???
- Relationships, that is, how things relate to each other
- Notice how in the definition of a category we don't care about the specifics of objects
- We don't care that integers are made of bits or strings are made of characters
- All we care about is that these concepts exist, and what morphisms they have coming and going
- That is, how they relate to each other and other concepts
- **Thinking about how things relate to each other is exactly the sort of thing that we need to be able to explore the idea space**
- So let's begin

---

> The language of categories is affectionately known as "abstract nonsense".

.footnote[Paolo Aluffi, Algebra: Chapter 0]

???
- Now that we know what a category is
- We can try to convert concepts from programming into the language of category theory
- That is, talk about them only in terms of objects and morphisms
- Once we manage to do that, we'll see how useful this point of view is
---
layout: true

## What's in a Tuple

---
???
- We'll start with tuples
- A pair of two types

--

.product[![](product-1.svg)]

???
- This is how mathematicians designate a tuple of `A` and `B`
- We say that it's a "product of `A` and `B`"
- Since category theory is about relationships, the first question to ask is
- How does a tuple of two types relate to anything else?
--

.product[![](product-2.svg)]

???
- Well, since a product of `A` and `B` is made out of `A` and `B`
- We must have a way to extract an `A` and a `B` from it
- So we have two morphisms that do exactly that, we say that we project `A` and `B` from the product
- Now, there are lots of things that can be decomposed into `A` and `B`

--

.product[![](product-3.svg)]

???

- Suppose `C` is one such thing
- How can we differentiate this tuple candidate from our product type?
- **In a sense, we want to find the object that is the "best fit" for being a tuple**
- Meaning that it's not "too big" or "too small" and contains exactly `A` and `B` and nothing else
- One way to do it, is to define what is called a "universal construction"

---

.product[![](product-4.svg)]

???

- The dashed arrow here is called a "universal morphism"
- Meaning that there's exactly one such morphism going from `C` to the product of `A` and `B`
- This resulting diagram is an example of a "commutative diagram"
- It means that for every way of getting from one point to another, we get the exact same result
- In this case we read it as follows
- For every tuple candidate `C`
- Projecting from `C` to either `A` or `B` is the same as first going from `C` to the product of `A` and `B` and then projecting to `A` and `B`
- And since `u` is universal there will be exactly one way to do that
- **This precisely captures the notion of being a tuple, not too big and not too small**
- If the product of `A` and `B` was too big, there would be more than one morphism like that pointing into it
- If it was too small, there wouldn't have been any morphisms with that property
- So this is the categorical way of defining a tuple
- **We are only describing how it relates to other things and we say nothing about its implementation details**
- This may seem as a rather roundabout way of doing things, but we immediately gain something
- Relationships can be reversed
- Quite literally, we can take this diagram and reverse all the arrows

---

.sum[![](sum.svg)]

???
- By doing this completely mechanical act, we've just discovered something new
- This is yet another commutative diagram for another universal construction
- Meaning that we have another concept on our hands
- But what is it?
- Well, it says that we can put an `A` into it, or a `B`, and it's "the best" such thing
- So it's either `A` or `B`, that is the `Either` type from functional programming
- Or, in mathematical speak, the "sum type"
- **This is quite amazing, with almost zero effort, we derived a new concept from another one**
- And what we did here is part of the general principle called "duality"

---
layout: false

## Duality

- Discover one idea, get another for free
- Completely mechanical
- Dual concepts are not always obviously related

???
- Duality gives us ideas for free
- Once we formulate some concept categorically, that is, by its relationships to other things
- We can invoke duality, just reverse all the arrows, and get another concept for free
- This is completely mechanical
- And sometimes, dual concepts can be very different from one another, and not obviously related
- **We get all this for free just by taking the categorical perspective**
- **From now on, pretty much for every new concept that I'll introduce, you can actually take away two concepts from it**
- **So this is our first tool to help us explore the idea space**
- But let's talk more deeply about these universal constructions we just saw

---
## Universal Constructions

???
- If you go down the path of defining concepts categorically, which you definitely should do
- Universal constructions crop up quite often
- We just saw the product construction

--

.universal.rawProduct[![](raw-product.svg)]

???
- But there are more
--

.universal.rawTerminal-object[![](raw-terminal-object.svg)]

.universal.rawEqualizer[![](raw-equalizer.svg)]

.universal.rawPullback[![](raw-pullback.svg)]

???
- All of these are useful concepts
- But if you look closely, there's something very repetitive here
- There's always some "best" object hanging above some pattern of other objects
- And there's always some other candidate for the same thing connected with a universal arrow
- **As a programmer, I find this repetition to be a bit annoying, like code that is not DRY or something like that**
- Luckily, it seems that mathematicians are very good at uncovering patterns and distilling their essence

---
layout: true

## Diagrams and Limits
---

???
- So what do we have here?
---

.diagrams[![](diagrams-1.svg)]

???
- We start out with some category
- And we want to single out some pattern in it
- So we'll use another category just for the pattern
--

.diagrams[![](diagrams-2.svg)]

???
- We call it the indexing category
- Here we are trying to describe the product pattern
- So we just have two objects in our indexing category
- To actually point out the pattern in our category of interest, we'll need to map from the indexing category into our category

--
.diagrams[![](diagrams-3.svg)]

???
- So each object in our indexing category is assigned to some object in our target category, singling out the desired pattern
- In this case, a pair of objects
- Formally speaking, we are building a functor from one category to the other, but I won't be going into that
- We call this construction a diagram of the indexing category
- This covers the pattern of objects in a universal construction
- So let's zoom in on this pattern

--
.diagrams[![](diagrams-4.svg)]

???
- Now let's tackle our "best" object
- The best object must have morphisms pointing into our diagram

--
.diagrams[![](diagrams-5.svg)]

???
- We call this a "cone over the diagram", since, well, it looks like a cone
- And there need to be some other candidate cones for that same role

--
.diagrams[![](diagrams-6.svg)]

???
- But since our cone is the best fit for being a cone, there's a universal arrow pointing from the candidates to our cone

--
.diagrams[![](diagrams-7.svg)]

???
- We call this cone the "limit of the diagram"
- Now, the limit captures all the parts of the universal construction pattern
- We have the shape and the best object over the shape
- In this case this limit describes the product contruction
---

.diagrams[![](diagrams-8.svg)]

???
- This may seem like we just replaced one universal construction with another
- But actually, by distilling this pattern into diagrams and limits, we gained something new
- We can now just draw some simple pattern

---

.titledDiagram.productDiagram[
.diagramTitle[
Product
]
.diagram[
![](product-diagram.svg)
]
]

???
- And each such pattern corresponds to that whole universal construction that I've shown before
- **So now it's "draw a picture get a concept"**
- **Actually, by duality, each diagram corresponds to two new concepts**
- **Since for every limit there's also the dual co-limit**
- **We've managed to minimize each concept to its essence**
- I find this very compact representation quite pleasing
- And we can draw more diagrams
- **Each new diagram representing yet another step in the idea space**
--

.titledDiagram.equalizerDiagram[
.diagramTitle[
Equalizer
]
.diagram[
![](equalizer-diagram.svg)
]
]

.titledDiagram.pullbackDiagram[
.diagramTitle[
Pullback
]
.diagram[
![](pullback-diagram.svg)
]
]

???

- And discover new concepts
- Although I won't be going into each of these diagrams, feel free to try and figure out what feature from the world of type systems corresponds to each such diagram
- We'll just take a look at this last diagram
--

.titledDiagram.terminalObjectDiagram[
.diagramTitle[
Terminal Object
]
.diagram[
![](terminal-object-diagram.svg)
]
]

???
- The empty diagram, with no objects
- It may seem trivial, but it's actually quite interesting

---
layout: true

## Initial and Terminal Objects
---

???
- We start by drawing a cone over our empty diagram
--

.terminalObject[![](terminal-1.svg)]

???
- That's just a single object, with no arrows
- We now say that for every other cone over the empty diagram

--
.terminalObject[![](terminal-2.svg)]

???
- That's just any other object in the category, since they are all cones over the empty diagram
- We have a unique morphism pointing into our limit
--
.terminalObject[![](terminal-3.svg)]

???
- We call this object the terminal object of the category
--
.terminalObject[![](terminal-4.svg)]

???
- And mark it with a `1`
- And of course there's the dual, the initial object
---

.terminalAndInitial[![](terminal-and-initial.svg)]

???
- So every object can be mapped uniquely into the terminal object
- And every object in the category can be reached uniquely from the initial object
- More concretely, in the category of types

--
.terminalAndInitialCode[
- Terminal: `()`
- Initial: `Void`
]

???
- The terminal object is `Unit`, a type with a single inhabitant
- The initial object is `Void`, a type with no inhabitants
- The initial and terminal objects can in some sense be thought of as the endpoints of the category
- And so, they are good starting points for exploring new categories
- As we'll do next
---

> Here’s a categorical rule of thumb: every time you have composition, you should look for a category.

.footnote[Bartosz Milewski's Programming Cafe]

???
- So far we've been looking within a single category, the category of types
- What I want to show next, is how we can find the structure of a category in other places
- And what insights we can gain from exploring these new categories
- We start with monoids
---

## Monoids

```
class Monoid a where
  combine :: (a, a) -> a
  empty :: () -> a
```

???
- Monoids are very common in programming
- They are the essence of combining values
- So a monoid over some type `a` lets us combine two values of `a` into one
- And also provides us with an empty value that just disappears during combination
- You might notice, that this is not the standard way of describing monoids
- But this way is more convenient for our purposes, since it will be easier to turn into a objects and morphisms
- As we'll do now
--

.monoid[![](monoid-1.svg)]

???
- So a monoid over some object `A`
--

.monoid[![](monoid-2.svg)]

???
- Has an arrow from a product of `A`s back to `A`
- This corresponds to `combine`

--

.monoid[![](monoid-3.svg)]

???
- And has an arrow from `Unit` back to `A`
- This corresponds to `empty`
- This is a bit of cheating
- Since in category theory we don't have a way of talking about specific elements of `A`
- Instead we talk about functions from `Unit` to `A`, which just correspond to constants, which are exactly the elements of `A`
- But now we have a diagram describing the concept of a monoid
- We can invoke the usual trick of duality and discover the dual of a monoid, a "co-monoid"
- Feel free to try to figure out later whether it's a useful thing or not
- Anyways, we are on a quest to build a new category
- Suppose we want to build the "category of monoids"
- Then a monoid over some object `A` is an object in our monoid category
- But what are the morphisms?

---

## Homomorphisms

.homomorphism[![](homomorphism-1.svg)]

???
- Suppose we have two monoids, one over `A` and another over `B`

--

.homomorphism[![](homomorphism-2.svg)]

???
- Then a morphism between the two is called a monoid homomorphism
- We'll denote these with squiggly arrows
- A homomorphism is not just any function between `A` and `B`
- Since we are dealing with monoids, a homomorphism must "respect" the monoid structure
- Specifically

--

.homomorphism[![](homomorphism-3.svg)]

???
- It should map the empty value of one monoid to the empty value of the other
- So that this diagram commutes
- It must also respect the combination function

--

.homomorphism[![](homomorphism-4.svg)]

???
- So that it doesn't matter whether we first combine two `A`s and then apply `h`
- Or we first apply `h` to both `A`s and then combine them using the `B` combination function
- So any function that makes this diagram commute will be a homomorphism
- **And it so happens that homomorphisms compose**
- **And every time you see composition, there's probably a category lurking around**

---

## The Monoid Category


.monoidCategory[![](monoid-category-1.svg)]

???
- Behold the monoid category
- Objects are monoids and morphisms are monoid homomorphisms
- Can we learn anything new from this category?
- Well, there's something interesting going on
- This new category is obviously related to the category of types that we started with
- It's the same category, but with some extra structure added to it
- Since category theory is naturally equipped for analyzing relationships
- This relationship is worth looking into
- Specifically, this relationship is about forgetting
- If we forget the monoid structure

--

.monoidCategory[![](monoid-category-2.svg)]

???
- We get back to our original category
- Let's try to think about this relationship more deeply
- Previously, we thought about reversing arrows
- Can we reverse this relationship?
- Well, forgetting is not really reversible though, since different monoids might be all mapped to the same underlying object
- But what really makes the monoid category special are its morphisms
- Since only a small part of the regular functions will be homomorphisms
- How can we deal with those in our un-forgetting process?
- Let's focus on some specific function

---

## Memories of Homomorphisms Past

.commaCategory[![](comma-category-1.svg)]

???
- If we pick some random function `f` from an object `A`, into some monoid `D`
- It's not likely to be a homomorphism
- But maybe it can be decomposed into parts

--

.commaCategory[![](comma-category-2.svg)]

???
- So we pick some other monoid, `C`, and decompose our original function into two parts, `g` and `h`
- Such that this triangle commutes
- `f` is still a regular function, but `h` is a homomorphism
- We can think of `h` as the homomorphic part of `f`
- If we focus on this part, maybe we can somehow un-forget ourselves back into the monoid category
- But, this decomposition may not be unique

--

.commaCategory[![](comma-category-3.svg)]

???
- There are many different ways to achieve the same goal
- The path through `B` here is an example of an alternative way
- But the suggestive way in which I've drawn this diagram implies that there's something lurking around here
- These functions from `A`, they are like steps from `A` towards the monoid world
- And we can move between these steps using monoid homomorphisms
- So we have composition
- **This should be our cue to start looking for a new category to define**
- Indeed, we can form a category here, a rather weird one
- Our objects are going to be functions from `A`, like a `f` and `g` here
- And morphisms in our new category are going to be homomorphisms that decompose them
- That is, that form commuting triangles between our objects, like we have here
- **This new category should somehow embody the notion of un-forgetting monoids from `A`**
- For some obscure reasons, this category is called a "comma category"
- **So let's explore this new category, maybe we'll learn something about the process of un-forgetting from it**
---

## Exploration

???
- As I mentioned in the previous part, a good place to start exploring categories is by looking at the initial or terminal objects
- So let's take a look at the initial object
--

.initalComma[![](initial-comma-1.svg)]

???
- Since objects in the comma category are functions from `A`, that's what our initial object is going to be
- By the definition of the initial object
- For every other object in the comma category
--

.initalComma[![](initial-comma-2.svg)]

???
- There will be a unique homomorphism between the initial object and the other object

--

.initalComma[![](initial-comma-3.svg)]

???
- So we just discovered a new universal construction
- **The combination of a new category and the old concept of initiality gave us something completely new**
- But what is this thing? Is it useful for anything?
- This is part of the challenge of using category theory for exploration
- **We must figure out on our own whether a newly discovered structure is actually useful for anything we care about**
- As we'll try do next

---

## Guess Who?

.unitComma[![](initial-comma-unit.svg)]

???
- For concreteness, let's pick `A` to be `Unit`
- And the monoid we are stepping into to be the integers with addition as the monoid action
- This should make it easier to discover what we have here
- So what do we have?
--

```
f () = 5

{{content}}
```

???
- Let's pick a specific `f`
- For example, given a `Unit` argument, it's going to return `5`
--
inj ()

{{content}}
???
- We'll call our initial morphism `inj`, short for "inject", as it injects into this mystery monoid here
- And so we have the result of applying `inj` to `Unit`
- Which we'll leave unspecified for the moment
- Since this is a commuting triangle, we know that

--
f () == 5 == h (inj ())

{{content}}

???
- Either applying `f` to `Unit`, or first applying `inj` and then `h` yields the same thing
- Hence the equation here
- We also know that `h` is a homomorphism, so it must preserve the empty monoid value

--
0 == h empty
{{content}}

???
- Giving us another equation
- We also know that the homomorphism must respect the monoid action
--

5 + 5 == (h (inj ())) + (h (inj ()))
{{content}}

???
- So if we combine two values that we already know
- We can pull `h` outside, and swap addition with the monoid action of the initial object

--
      == h ((inj ()) `op` (inj ()))
{{content}}

???
- Since we don't yet know what this action does, I'll just call it `op`
- We can repeat this process and derive new equations
--

5 + 5 + 5 ==
  h ((inj ()) `op` (inj ()) `op` (inj ()))
{{content}}

???
- As many times as we want
--

5 + 5 ... + 5 ==
  h ((inj ()) `op` (inj ()) ... `op` (inj ()))

???
- Since all the values on the left are unique, so are the values on the right
- We are effectively generating values in our mystery monoid

---
## Guess Who?

```
empty
(inj ()) `op` (inj ())
(inj ()) `op` (inj ()) `op` (inj ())
...
(inj ()) `op` (inj ()) ... `op` (inj ())
```

???
- So all of these are unique values from the new monoid that we found so far
- We have the empty value and `op` delimited chains of other values
- The structure that we have here is a bit obscured by bad naming
- If we rename to something more suggestive
---
## Guess Who?

```
[]
[()] ++ [()]
[()] ++ [()] ++ [()]
...
[()] ++ [()] ... ++ [()]
```

???
- We see that what we have here is the structure of arbitrary length lists of `Unit`
- The monoid action appends two lists
- And the `inj` function wraps `Unit` into a list
- In general
---

## The Free Monoid

- The initial object over `A` is `[A]`
- `inj` builds a singleton list
- `h == foldMap f`
- No junk and no noise

???
- What we just discovered is called the free monoid
- For an arbitrary `A` the initial object is just a list of `A`s
- `inj` builds a singleton list
- And the unique homomorphism is created by the `foldMap` function, known from Haskell's standard library
- The universality of the homomorphism ensures that
- We have "no junk", there are no extra elements beyond what is necessary to become a monoid, otherwise the homomorphism will not be unique
- And we have "no noise", as there are no equations between the elements beyond what the monoid structure requires us to have, otherwise the homomorphism won't always exist
- **So what we have here is the minimal way to build a monoid out of any `A`**
- **By exploring this new category, which was the embodiment of un-forgetting**
- **We've managed to deduce the minimal way to un-forget**
- Circling back to the quote at the beginning of this part
- When you see composition, there may be a category lurking around
- Learning about the structure of that category can lead to interesting new insights
- Like the free monoid we just discovered
- Hopefully, our exploration of the monoid and comma categories managed to illustrate this point

> I don't want to make any sweeping generalizations, but all I'll say is...

.footnote[Anyone, before making a sweeping generalization]

???
- So far, we've been looking at concepts within specific categories
- We'll now see how we can generalize concepts and move them between categories
- This will seriously boost our ability to explore the idea space
---

## Monoids Redux

.monoidGeneralization[![](monoid-generalization-1.svg)]

???
- This is the monoid definition that we had before
- If we take a deeper look at it, it's not quite "portable"
- The usage of `Unit` here makes it hardcoded for a specific category, namely, the category of types
- **Similarly to how programmers like portable code, mathematicians like portable definitions**
- Definitions that we can reuse in various contexts
- Let's fix this and generalize the monoid
- Now, the unit here is not the only problem, and even not the main problem
- The product here is problematic as well
- It's a very specific construction and it really constrains what we can do with it
- But if we think about it, in the definition of the monoid we didn't actually use anything specific to the product
- All we want is some notion of "two-ness", but we don't really care whether we have two copies of `A`, we just want an object that is a function of two `A`s
- The product is just a specific case of it
- Let's replace it with something more general
--

.monoidGeneralization[![](monoid-generalization-2.svg)]

???
- This new symbol here is called the "tensor product"
- It's basically any well-behaved function of two objects
- But we don't specify what function exactly
- So it could be the usual product, but it can be something else as well
- Now we can take care of the `Unit` here
- When I first introduced it in the definition of the monoid, I said it was our way to reference specific elements of `A`
- But that's only part of the story
- It has another role as well, it's the identity object of the product
--

.identityObject1[![](identity-object-1.svg)]

???
- Which means that the product of any `A` with `Unit` is equivalent to `A`
- Which makes sense, since `Unit` doesn't contain any new information
- We need the equivalent for the tensor product

--

.identityObject2[![](identity-object-2.svg)]

???
- We'll call it `I`, for the identity object
- Each instance of the tensor product will have its own identity object
- And we can now use it in our generalized monoid
--

.monoidGeneralization[![](monoid-generalization-3.svg)]

???
- So we no longer reference the category of types
- This makes the definition of the monoid very generic, or portable, and will open some interesting doors for us
- But first, let's introduce a new category

---
layout: true

## The Category of Endofunctors
---

???
- In order to demonstrate how portable our generalized monoid is, we'll need a radically new category
- The category of endofunctors
--

- Objects: endofunctors
  - `Functor f`
  - `Functor g`

???
- Our objects are now what in category theory is called endofunctors
- Or in programming, somewhat confusingly, any type constructor that forms the usual `Functor` from functional programming 
- So the objects are not regular types, but type-constructors
--

- Morphisms: natural transformations
  - `forall a. f a -> g a`

???
- Mappings between functors are called natural transformations
- I won't delve into them generally, but in programming they just correspond to parametric functions
- Ones that uniformly take us from a type constructor `f` to a type constructor `g`
- For example

--

  - `maybeToList :: forall a. Maybe a -> [a]`
  - `reverse :: forall a. [a] -> [a]`

???
- This maps from the type-constructor `Maybe` to the type-constructor `List`
- Both of them having a `Functor` instance
- For us to have a monoid, we'll need a tensor product

---

- Tensor product: functor composition
  - `(f ⊗ g) a = f (g a)`

???
- For this purpose, we'll use functor composition
- So a tensor product of two functors is the application of one functor to the other
- We'll also need the identity of the tensor
--

- Identity object: the identity functor
  - `type Id a = a`

???
- This happens to be the identity functor, one that takes types to themselves
- Since composing the identity functor with any other doesn't change anything
- With all of this data, we can now build a monoid in this new category

---
layout: false

## (Endo) Functor Monoids

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-1.svg)]

???
- We start with our generalized monoid
- Since our elements are now functors, let's replace the letters
--

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-2.svg)]

???
- Next, the identity object is the identity functor
--

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-3.svg)]

???
- Now, since it's a bit inconvenient to talk about functors generically
- I'm going to quantify the whole diagram with the type to which we apply the functor to
--

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-4.svg)]

???
- So I'm saying that the diagram applies "for all `A`"
- This means that I can reference `A` in the diagram, but it can be any `A` whatsoever
- So the identity functor applied to `A` is just `A`
--

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-5.svg)]

???
- We can apply `F` to `A` as well
--

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-6.svg)]

???
- And now we change the tensor product to functor composition
--

.functorMonoids[![](functor-monoid-7.svg)]

???
- So what do we have here?

---
layout: true

## (Endo) Functor Monoids

.functorMonoidsSmall[![](functor-monoid-8.svg)]

---
???
- Let's repeat this process with code
---

```
class Monoid a where
  combine :: a ⊗ a -> a

  empty :: I -> a
```

???
- This is the generalized monoid in code
- Let's apply it to the endofunctor category
---

```
class Functor f => Monoid f where
  combine :: a ⊗ a -> a

  empty :: I -> a
```

???
- Instead of a concrete type `a`, we now have a type constructor `f` and a `Functor` constraint
- Now we replace the functions with natural transformations with the appropriate types

---

```
class Functor f => Monoid f where
  combine :: forall a. (f ⊗ f) a -> f a

  empty :: forall a. a -> f a
```
???
- Replace the tensor product with functor composition
---

```
class Functor f => Monoid f where
  combine :: forall a. f (f a) -> f a

  empty :: forall a. a -> f a
```

???
- As an aside, can you think of other interesting tensor products in this category? What will they yield here?
- This is starting to look familiar
- A quick rename

---

```
class Functor f => Monad f where
  join :: f (f a) -> f a

  return :: a -> f a
```

???
- What we just rediscovered, rather mechanically, is the definition of the monad structure
- We can even define the more standard `bind` operator in terms of the functions that we have here
---

```
class Functor f => Monad f where
  join :: f (f a) -> f a

  return :: a -> f a

  (>>=) :: f a -> (a -> f b) -> f b
  (>>=) f k = join (fmap k f)
```

???
- And this what gave birth to the now famous, or maybe infamous quote

--
.monadQuote[
> A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?
]

???
- A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors
- **So generalizing and moving between categories is a very powerful technique**
- **Look how far apart are the two concepts we just connected**
- **Can you imagine discovering the connection between monoids and monads without the wide perspective that category theory gives us?**

---
layout: false

## Moving Between Categories

- Knowledge reuse on overdrive

???
- And what's great about this portability, is that all of our derived knowledge about monoids can be adapted to this new category
--

- Free Monoids `->` Free Monads
- Comonoids `->` Comonads

???
- The concept of the free monoid yields the very useful notion of the free monad
- The dual concept also applies, so we just rediscovered comonads
--

- Laws and Proofs
- Code (?)

???
- Although I didn't talk about them, these abstractions are also equipped with various laws, these can be ported as well
- And maybe, in a sufficiently advanced language, we can actually reuse the same code for these different abstractions
- **Imagine achieving this level of reuse with just regular code and without category theory to show you the way**
- Now we are ready for our last part

<br /> It would be utterly **astonishing** if this were not deeply useful for programming.

.footnote[Ken Scambler, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KenScambler/status/1117622023163826176)]

???
- I'll try to get a bit closer to code and show how techniques that we've learned so far can be applied in programming

---

## "Case Study"

???
- It's not an actual case study, because there isn't any real case
- But nonetheless
--

```
mySpecialListFunction :: Monoid m =>
  [a] -> m

{{content}}
```

???
- Imagine that you're writing some code
- A function from a list to some monoid
- You tediously spell out the recursion over the list and gather the results into your monoid
- But then you recall that `List` is the free monoid
- And from its intiality in the relevant category, you have `foldMap`
--
-- Initiality
foldMap :: Monoid m =>
  (a -> m) -> [a] -> m

{{content}}

???
- `foldMap` saves us the effort of manually iterating over the list and accumulating the results
- We just specify the action over single elements and the rest is handled for us
- But why stop there, we just learned to generalize
- Moving to the category of endofunctors we get
--
-- Generalization
foldFree :: (Monad m, Functor f) =>
  (forall x. f x -> m x) -> Free f a -> m a

{{content}}

???
- `foldFree`
- This is a useful function that actually appears in libraries, and it's the basic building block for working with free monads
- We now also know about duality, so let's apply that as well
--
-- Duality
unfoldCofree :: (Comonad w, Functor f) =>
  (forall x. w x -> f x) -> w a -> Cofree f a

???

- So we just discovered a new structure: cofree comonads
- And again, this function is very useful when working with them
- **Look at these three type-signatures, and what an amazing journey in the idea space they imply**
- **These are the sort of exploration tools that category theory gives us**
- Speaking of which

---
## The Tools for Thought

???
- We can now take a step back and admire what we have

--

.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-1.svg)]

???
- So starting from the familiar concepts of products and monoids
- We used three tools to explore the idea space

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-2.svg)]

???
- Duality
- Automatically discovering one concept from another

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-3.svg)]
???
- Initiality
- Bringing us free constructions

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-4.svg)]

???
- And generalization
- Allowing us to port definitions into completely new circumstances
- And we can keep on applying these tools

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-5.svg)]

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-6.svg)]

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-7.svg)]

???
- Going further and further and further around the idea space

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-8.svg)]

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-9.svg)]

???
- But this is just scratching the surfaces
- Category theory can provide us with so many other tools

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-10.svg)]

???
- The Yoneda lemma

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-11.svg)]

???
- Adjunctions

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-12.svg)]

???
- Kan extensions, that were mentioned in the beginning of this talk
- And these are all reusable components, so we can just keep on mix and matching all of these

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-13.svg)]

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-14.svg)]

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-15.svg)]

???
- Reaching ever expanding areas of the idea space

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-16.svg)]

--
.categoricalExploration[![](categorical-exploration-17.svg)]

???

- And we are still just scratching the surface of what category theory can give us
- **Imagine having all of these tools at your disposal**
- **What sort of things will you be able to discover using category theory as your tool for thought?**
- And since this is all I have for you today, I'll leave you with this rather cryptic quote to ponder about
